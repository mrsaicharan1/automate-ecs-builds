Create a CodeBuild project to build the CodeCommit repository into a docker container

In order to be able to push to ECR, we will need to update the service
role that was created in the project wizard.  Add:
AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser
to the role in the IAM console

We should be able to build the latest master at this point.
